Metrics such as silhouette score, Davies–Bouldin index, and Rand index are commonly used for this purpose. Silhouette score measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters, with values ranging from -1 to 1. A higher silhouette score indicates better clustering. Davies–Bouldin index evaluates the average similarity between each cluster and its most similar cluster, with lower values indicating better clustering. Rand index compares the similarity between pairs of objects in the same or different clusters. High Rand index values suggest better clustering results. Understanding these metrics helps in selecting the most appropriate clustering algorithm for a given dataset.",
