It provides the structure for web content by using a system of tags that define elements within a page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets, and most tags come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.\n\nHTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. An element consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag. The content is the information displayed on the page. Elements can also have attributes that provide additional information about the element.\n\nHTML documents are made up of a hierarchy of elements. The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines the document type and version of HTML used. The `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML page, and it contains metadata about the document. The `<head>` element includes information about the document, such as the title and links to external resources. The `<body>` element contains the content that appears on the web page.\n\nHTML tags are used to structure content on a webpage. Common tags include `<h1>` to `<h6>` for headings, `<p>` for paragraphs, `<a>` for links, `<img>` for images, and `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>` for lists.\n\n",
