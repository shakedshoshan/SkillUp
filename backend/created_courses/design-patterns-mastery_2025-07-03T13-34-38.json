Understanding design patterns is crucial for creating maintainable, scalable, and efficient code. There are three main categories of design patterns: creational, structural, and behavioral patterns. Each category serves a specific purpose in software design. Design patterns help in promoting code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability. By implementing design patterns, developers can enhance the structure of their code, make it more understandable, and reduce the risk of errors and bugs.

In this lesson, we will delve into three key behavioral design patterns: Observer, Strategy, and Template Method. These patterns enable developers to define how objects communicate and behave in various scenarios, promoting flexibility and reusability in the codebase. By understanding these patterns, developers can enhance the modularity and maintainability of their software systems.",
